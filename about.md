### A fun list about this upcoming protect

The big question I am looking at is 'What does the data this say about this era of the Web?'

- Material concerns: What the minimum and maximum sizes of websites? This would be inflected by the etimated load time on varying modems, which I can find independent of my data. 
- Aesthetics: What were the aesthetic trends (most common background color, for example)
- Time period: How was language used? For example, how many instances do we see of 'blog' versus 'social media' when the text is mined?


### More Information

My interests include big sharks, such as what is depicted in the image below.

Behold, the shork:
